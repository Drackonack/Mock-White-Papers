# Mock White Papers
Showcasing a few mock white papers I've written.

**Paper 01**

Optimisation of a perceptron based binary classifier for the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset. Achieved through increasing complexity of architecture from single layer, to multi layer, and finally an optimised multi layer with normalisation and regularisation.

**Paper 02**

Finetuning 3 Convolutional Neural Networks, ResNet50, EfficientNet B0, and VGG16, then using their strengths to produce an improved amalgamated model to classify the CIFAR-10 dataset.

**Paper 03**

Optimising a single RNN architecture and associated hyperparameters from a battery of 3; SimpleRNN, LSTM, and GRU.
